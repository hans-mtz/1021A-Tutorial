## Problem 2.11

Suppose that Yucatan’s production possibilities are:

## Problem 2.11

(a) Draw a graph of Yucatan’s PPF and explain how your graph illustrates a tradeoff.
(b) If Yucatan produces 150 kilograms of food per month, how much sunscreen must it produce if it achieves production efficiency?
(c) What is Yucatan’s opportunity cost of producing (i) 1 kilogram of food and (ii) 1 litre of sunscreen?
(d) What is the relationship between your answers to part (c)?

## Problem 2.11 SOLUTIONS

(a) The graph illustrates a tradeoff because **production of one good can only be increased if production of the other good is decreased** as we move along the graph.
(b) Allocative efficiency = **on the PPF**. 150 kilograms of food per month: 75 litres of sunscreen. 
(c) 1 kg of food : 0.5 L of sunscreen. Likewise, 2 kg food: 1 L sunscreen.
(d) The opportunity costs of the two goods are **inversely related**.

## Problem 2.13

In Problem 2.11, what is the marginal cost of 1 kilogram of food in Yucatan when the quantity produced is 150 kilograms per day? What is special about the marginal cost of food in Yucatan?

## Problem 2.13 SOLUTION

- The marginal cost of 1 kilogram of food in Yucatan is **constant** at all points along Yucatan’s PPF and is equal to 0.5 litres of sunscreen per kilogram of food. 
- Constant marginal cost = linear PPF.


## Problem 2.14

The table describes the preferences in Yucatan.

![](prefs.png){width=100%}

## Problem 2.14

(a) What is the marginal benefit from sunscreen and how is it measured?
(b) Using the table from Problem 2.11, what does Yucatan produce to achieve allocative efficiency?

## Problem 2.14 SOLUTION

(a) The marginal benefit from sunscreen is the **benefit enjoyed by the person who consumes 1 more** litre of sunscreen. It is equal to the willingness to pay for an additional litre.
(b) Allocative efficiency = Yucatan is **producing at the point on the PPF that is most preferred.**: MB = MC. 

MC of 1 L of sunscreen = 2 kg of food. 

$\implies$ MB = 2. 

$\implies$ Yucatan should produce 75 L of sunscreen. 

$\implies$ to be at the PPF, Yucatan must produce 150 kg of food.

## Problem 2.20

Tony and Patty produce skis and snowboards. The tables show their production possibilities. Each week, Tony produces 5 snowboards and 40 skis; Patty produces 10 snowboards and 5 skis.

## Problem 2.20

![](tp.png){width=70%}

## Problem 2.20

(a) Who has the comparative advantage in producing (i) snowboards and (ii) skis?
(b) If Tony and Patty specialize and trade 1 snowboard for 1 ski, what are the gains from trade?

## Problem 2.20 SOLUTIONS

(a) The worker who has the comparative advantage in producing snowboards is the one who has the **lowest opportunity cost** of producing 1 snowboard.

Tony: 1 snowboard: 2 skis
Patty: 1 snowboard: 0.5 skis

$\implies$ Patty has the lower opportunity cost 

$\implies$ Patty has the comparative advantage of producing snowboards.

## Problem 2.20 SOLUTIONS

(b) Gains from trade. $20-15= 5 SB$; $50-45= 5 Skis$

Currently,

If Tony and Patty specialize and trade,

## Recap

- Production efficiency is achieved at the PPF.
- The PPF illustrates graphically the opportunity cost of producing one good in terms of the other.
- Constant marginal cost = Linear PPF.
- Allocative efficienty is achieved at the PPF point that is most preferred. MB = MC.
- Comparative advantage = lowest opportunity cost.
